///their are four types of loops 
///while loop// the purpose of while loop is to execute a statment or block of code repetedly as long the condition is true if the condition is false the loop will be exited
//syntax///
//while (condition){
	//block to be exected}
///
//for example  give that the condition to print 0 to 5 numbers
var i=0;
while(i<=5)
{
	document.write("the number is i++");
	document.write("<br>")
	i++;
}
//if see the out put it will print up to 5numbers and and after that it will not print it will exit//

//do while loop///-this loop will execute the code before hecking if it is true orfalse if tthe condition repeat the loop untill the condition is true
var i=0;
while(i<=5)
{
	document.write("the number is i++");
	document.write("<br>")

///for loop///
///intialize condition increment// this arre the three thing we need to use  to write the for loop//
